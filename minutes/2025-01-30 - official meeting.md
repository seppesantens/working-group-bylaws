## Questions & Remarks

* Thierry does paid mapping but gives everything to OSM.be, **Julien wonders what the hourly rate is (see answer below)**
* Joost would like to hear ideas about something to do with RouteYou
* Costs for Municipalia are not yet clear but we're invited so we're not paying for the booth
* Marketing budget could be use to hire Cabinet Content to organise a marketing campaign
* OSM weekend/day:
  * Make sure to invite active non-members (to try to bring more people)
  * FOSS4G BE workshop day could also be used to meet people (but would be during the week)
  * Or communicate it more broadly but say you should become member to come
* There's also a desire for a more informational/formal event. In the past there were knowledge exchanges like this. For instance, share JOSM tips, ...
  * "Regular" meetup could also be used to focus on (a) specific topic(s)

What is hourly rate for paid mapping?
: 65.9571 EUR per hour (TVA not included). We used this rate for a one shot project (paid mapping cycle highways). In the future we might reconsider this rate.
